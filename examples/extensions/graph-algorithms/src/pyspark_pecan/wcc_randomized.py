"""Seeded randomized contraction with affine-hashed representatives.

The algorithm is Bögeholz, Brand and Todor, "In-database connected component
analysis" (ICDE 2020), in the form graphframes-rs implements it: every round
draws an affine map f(x) = a*x + b over GF(2^64) with a != 0 (a permutation of
the 64-bit ids), each vertex takes the minimum of f over its closed
neighbourhood as its representative, and the edges are relabelled by those
representatives until none remain. Representatives are the hashed ids
themselves, so a round is one union, one grouped minimum and a `least`: no
priority table, no `min_by`, no join to recover an original id.

The back pass unwinds the rounds: a representative that was forwarded takes
the later round's label; one that dropped out (its id had no edge in later
rounds) is pushed into the final id space by the composition of the later
affine maps, computed on the client in the same field. The final labels are
hashed ids; the default then relabels each component by the minimum original
id of its members (one aggregate and one join), which `canonical_labels=False`
skips, because any label set names the same partition.
